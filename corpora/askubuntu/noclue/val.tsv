duplicate	Setup with BIOS but GPT partition table (due to 3 TB disk)?<p>How can I use a disk with GPT partition table on a system with a BIOS but no (U)EFI?</p>  <p>I have a system with a 3 TB drive (no other drives and since this is <em>a remote machine</em> I have no choices here) and with a GPT for obvious reasons. Ubuntu 12.04 is being bootstrapped onto the system and this worked so far. Now after bind-mounting <code>/dev</code>, <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> from the host into the target system and <code>chroot</code>ing into it, I installed <code>linux-image-server</code> which worked fine (after linking <code>/sbin/initctl</code> as <code>/bin/true</code>). Because this is a remote machine I have to do all of this via SSH and have no bootable CD or anything. I can boot into a rescue system if it fails, though (PXE).</p>  <p>Now I know that <code>grub2</code> is supposed to support the scenario, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to install it.</p>  <p>The boot (and root) device is to be <code>/dev/md0</code>, composed of <code>/dev/sda1</code> and <code>/dev/sdb1</code> in RAID mode 0. With <code>/dev/md0</code> mounted under <code>/target</code> I am running:</p>  <pre><code>grub-install --root-directory=/target --no-floppy /dev/sda </code></pre>  <p>which fails with:</p>  <pre><code>/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: This GPT partition label has no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible!. /usr/sbin/grub-setup: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required when the root device is on a RAID array or LVM volume. </code></pre>  <p>So how can I get <code>grub2</code> installed in order to have this BIOS-based system boot properly?</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> it doesn't matter whether I run this inside or outside the <code>chroot</code> environment. The error and output are identical. Likely because I bind-mounted <code>/dev</code> etc into place. Of course appropriate adjustments to the command line (no <code>--root-directory=</code>) have been made.</p> 	Ubuntu 13.10 error installing GRUB- dual boot w/ Windows 8 separate disks<p>I am basically completely new to Linux, so I do not have a lot of terminology knowledge right here.

Is there anything, that I missed? Thanks, Armin</p> 	How is ubuntu live user graphical session (startx) started up in a LiveCD?<p>I am trying to build a custom ISO, using <code>ubuntu-builder</code>. I've taken a 12.40 mini remix ISO as a starting point. Here is my specific example - however, I'm interested in principle how the process goes (so I can apply that to other DE/WM).  </p>  <p>when I run a new ISO, built directly from the mini remix starting ISO, all is as expected - I can run the new ISO in a virtual machine, and the boot process terminates with text-only prompt for the live <code>ubuntu</code> user. </p>  <p>Now, I try to install LXDE (there is an entry for it in <code>ubuntu-builder</code>, apparently it installs <code>lxde-core</code> and X dependencies; and I manually have to install <code>lxterminal</code>, and as icons are missing, probably <code>lxde-icon-theme</code> as well). I have to also manually install <code>xinit</code>, so I have <code>startx</code>. But this, by itself, doesn't do much: if I boot this customized ISO in a virtual machine, the exact same thing happens as with the "original" ISO - boot process completes with a text mode prompt for <code>ubuntu</code> live user. </p>  <p>If I now type <code>startx</code> at this prompt, then LXDE starts (running <code>startlxde</code> at this prompt will complain about X), such that when you start <code>lxterminal</code> from that desktop, it is started under the live <code>ubuntu</code> user.</p>  <hr>  <p>In <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization#Boot_init" rel="nofollow">LiveCDCustomization - Boot init</a>, it is mentioned:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Boot init<br>   You have to edit the files in edit/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/* For example you can change the hostname or the livecd user. </p> </blockquote>  <p>... but I don't exactly understand what is exactly being ran by what there. The <code>ubuntu-builder</code> unpacks these files under <code>/home/ubuntu-builder/FileSystem/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/</code> - but as far as I can see, most of these just run some inline <code>sed</code> commands, I cannot see much executive commands there? </p>  <p>Still, I tried to copy one of the scripts there as a new script, <code>51startx</code>, which in the executable section has:</p>  <pre><code>log_begin_msg "$DESCRIPTION"  chroot /root startx chroot /root startlxde  log_end_msg </code></pre>  <p>This does absolutely nothing - again, after boot, I get the usual text prompt <code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$</code>. </p>  <hr>  <p>Then I found <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/showthread.php?t=40457" rel="nofollow">Modify: Startx automatically, add apt, etc - backtrack-linux.org</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>To have a graphical login, just install gdm and run it in startup:</p>  <pre>aptitude update aptitude install gdm</pre>      <p>Then, edit /etc/rc.local, and add a line BEFORE "exit 0" like this:</p>  <pre>service gdm start</pre>      <p>This is not the best way, but run! . This must work running "update-rc.d gdm defaults", but this way fail. </p> </blockquote>  <p>And indeed - I added:</p>  <pre><code>startx startlxde </code></pre>  <p>... to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> - and this indeed does boot, and start LXDE automatically - however, when I run <code>lxterminal</code>, it is under user <code>root</code> - not under the live user <code>ubuntu</code>!</p>  <hr>  <p>So, what should I do, so that I can start (any) X and/or any desktop environment automatically at boot under the live <code>ubuntu</code> user? </p>  <p>Note that in this case, I would <strong>not</strong> like to use an additional desktop manager (e.g. <code>gdm</code>) nor a corresponding greeter - but it would be good to know, if a solution for automatically starting up X would also work for a desktop manager or a greeter.</p>

non-duplicate	MySQL access via PHP doesn't find database<p>I installed apache2, php5, mysql-server, php5-mysql, phpmyadmin in that order on Ubuntu 12.04 with the Software Center. Apache and PHP works fine, no problems. Also, if I try to work with MySQL via phpmyadmin, everything works as expected. Problems start, when I want to use MySQL via PHP. For this I tried the following script:</p>  <pre><code>$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pw) OR die(mysql_errno()." ".mysql_error()); mysql_select_db($db, $connection) OR die(mysql_errno()." ".mysql_error()); </code></pre>  <p>This returns "1046 No database selected". I'm sure that the database exists, I even tried it with the standard "test"-database and root as the user. What made me really curious, is that when I use a non-existent user ("asdf"), the same message appears and no failure from the mysql_connect-function.</p>  <p>This leads me to the suspicion, that I struggle with user rights in the Linux system, because it works with phpmyadmin, which is not installed via a webinstaller but via the Software Center. I can only guess that hence, phpmyadmin has other rights to access MySQl than PHP, but I don't know, how to approach the problem. After trying and googleing for hours, I feel a bit lost now.

non-duplicate	Upgrading Ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10 broke my system, completely.<p>First, I hope that this is not a duplicate, because I found my question quite strange and unique, and I don't have any idea with it. <br> These days I heard of the new Ubuntu release, version 13.10 and I am quite excited. I have been stuck in 12.04 for such a long time and it's time for a good upgrade. So...I ran <code>update-manager -d</code> and tried to go up to 12.10. (I decided to go up one by one)<br> It took a very long time to download all the required kernel and packages...and soon installing...and some questions asking me if I want to replace the old config files. I did some tweaking with that system before (changing startup applications, TMPFS, zram-enabler, etc) and I thought that it will cause a real crash if I keep these config files. So, I replaced all of them but it goes too slow and it's time I've to go to school. I asked my grandfather if he could help me to click all the 'Replace' buttons for me and shut down the computer after the upgrade finished. <br> When I was back from school, he told me that he accidentally clicked 'Keep' for the last popup box, and my computer can't function now. The grub menu is still there (made it appear by using the SHIFT key trick), and the splash screen is still visible, and I hope that the login screen is still there, or at least the <code>tty</code> so that I can still do a rescue, but nothing worked. CTRL+ALT+F1 does nothing, and I am sure that the monitor is still functioning. <br> So what can I do now? </p> 	Cannot start ubuntu 12.04: URGENT<p>I am haveing problems with my 3g USB internet stick (HSUPA MF195).

Gparted shows the same 4 partitions that Mac does, and I remember when installing Ubuntu the installation tool showed some other small "free spaces" between partitions.</p>  <p>To fix the tables, I have tried to <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11215214&amp;postcount=185" rel="nofollow">install GDISK in Mac</a> and follow the instructions from that Forum post, but after I wrote <code>sudo gdisk /dev/disk0</code> in Terminal (and after writting my password) I get <code>dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022 Trace/BPT trap</code>.

non-duplicate	Automatic Updates and Update Caches<p>I am considering trying to build a portable IT system to support Job Clubs here in the UK (operating as a charitable enterprise), but have a couple of hurdles to overcome. The solution I have in mind will incorporate up to 10 laptops sharing a common router, portable server and other network facilities like printer, etc.</p>  <p>Firstly, I have avoided using Windows because of the excessively large number of updates, extra security software required to keep it stable and malware-free as well as the high cost of support and maintenance needed. I like Mac OS X as it is rock-solid stable, updates are automatic, not too frequent and not too large, but the hardware carries a high premium. I have played with a couple of variants of Linux, but found that some require regular manual updates every week, which makes support a pain.</p>  <p>Q1. Can Ubuntu be configured for automatic updates for all its software, so that it is completely transparent to the end-user? I basically do not want the end-users fiddling with Ubuntu or any of its applications at all, but at the same time need it to keep itself up to date as far as is possible with minimal intervention. </p>  <p>Secondly, I have limited bandwidth in some places the system will be used at (e.g. where no landline-based broadband is available) and it will have to run over a 3G wireless internet connection. In this situation I do not want updates to run as bandwidth is precious. Also, even when on the main base-site which has fixed-line broadband, updates for 10 machines will consume a lot of bandwidth.</p>  <p>I know that if I were to implement a solution based on Mac OS X, the OS X server can be configured to act as a local update cache server. E.g. each of the client laptops would pull their updates from the local LAN server rather than Apple's main update server. Thus update-related bandwidth would be reduced to 10% of what it would be without the update server on the LAN.</p>  <p>Q2 - does Ubuntu have the ability to time when updates are done (e.g. delay an update until it is at a high-bandwidth site?)</p>  <p>Q3 - does Ubuntu have the ability to use a local LAN-based server as an Update Cache instead of having to pull updates across from Ubuntu's main repositories?</p> 	Word processor with less overhead then Open/Libre Office?<p>I'll be honest I've run both OpenOffice and Libre Office and I'm not impressed with their speed/resource consumption both of them lag on my laptop and I don't think it's because of my hardware, for example Kile a Latex development environment based on Kate runs better although it's doing, I think more stuff in the background.</p>  <p>So is there another office suite/ word processor for a Kubuntu 12.10 installation, going with Kate seems too low end while doing everything in Kile is bringing in the big guns to early. </p>  <p>I am mainly interested in speed and of course saving in a reasonably used format, not in having a lot of bells and whistles.</p>

I'd suggest Canonical starting it off by funding a bounty pool, where fixing 1 bug counts as 1 share of the sum of money. The Ubuntu community could then contribute additional funds if they wish.</p>  <p>I'd suggest the following procedure:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Developers need to complete one bite-sized bug to be eligible.</p></li> <li><p>Completing (i.e. the bug is marked as “fix committed”) a non bite-sized bug gets the developer one share of the bounty pool. </p></li> <li><p>More complex bugs could carry additional weighting and count as 2 or more shares.</p></li> <li><p>Developers who've already completed bugs get one share per bug completed to start with, therefore rewarding them for their contribution.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I think this would encourage more developers to join in Unity development and give existing developers further incentive to fix more bugs. It also provides a way for non-developers to feel they are helping with the software development. No specifications would need to be written up.</p>  <p>If this or something similar could be made to work for Unity, it should also work for other open source software, e.g. Libreoffice, Mozilla Thunderbird &amp; Lightning, etc. Which would give a much needed boost to open source on the desktop.</p>

So I installed Nautilus and made it the preferred File Manager from exo-preferred-applications.

Also tried with a symlink for xfdesktop -> nautilus as suggested in some thread but that didn't do the trick either.</p>  <p>The error occurs whenever I try copying or moving something (a file or a folder) from the desktop to another location (by Ctrl+C or Copy from the context menu). Copying and moving works from and to other locations (even from a random location to the desktop but not from it). The strangest part is that when I drag and drop a file or folder from the Desktop to the desired location it works without any errors. </p>  <p>I would be grateful if someone could help me.

duplicate	Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some "red flags" to watch out for?<p>I see a lot of interesting programs out there that can only be obtained by adding a "PPA" to the system but, if I'm understanding correctly, we should stay within the official "repositories" for adding software to our system.

Browsing forums to see if the author has trust of others is not good enough (and lengthy); looking at author's websites whether they look legit is silly imho.</p>  <p>To have an example,<br>  <em>there is a WebUpd8 APP by Alin Andrei that seems to have a good reputation. Their <a href="https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/webupd8" rel="nofollow">Lanchpad site</a> shows details about the package including updates. That's useful, alright. I think I need more to get confidence the software is qualit enough and without malicious intentions. For example, how can I see how many people actively use it or what problems they experienced?</em></p>  <p>The obvious problem<br> with packages coming from third party is that they might be unintentionally bugged or otherwise imperfect and cause problems (possibly hard to solve for a newbie user especially) or intentionally containing malicious software. Now we are a community so how do we cover this risk? I'd expect some sensible system, as is usually the case with unix, but so far when this question was asked the answers did not mention any method for a trust verification.<br> I'm afraid of hackers who gain credibility and one day flip to the dark side and include some listening backdoor malware into the packages they distribute.

The answers don't provide any tool or method with which I could verify or quantify the trust myself. I don't have enough reputation to comment there, so I'm asking separate question. I'm after some method of collecting evidence on which I can base my opinion whether to trust a certain PPA or not.

non-duplicate	`make install` fails apparently due to typo, but not in makefile: How to find and fix?<p>I'm trying to install the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cybergene/fujitsu-usb-touchscreen/get/112fdb75b406.zip" rel="nofollow">fujitsu-usb-touchscreen</a> drivers from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cybergene/fujitsu-usb-touchscreen/overview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, on Kubuntu 12.04 on my new Fujitsu LifeBook P1630. (See <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/345639/fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-on-kubuntu-13-04-64-bit-on-p1630-make-errors">fujitsu-usb-touchscreen on kubuntu 13.04 (64-bit) on P1630: `make` errors</a>.) I downloaded the .zip file, unzipped it, and ran <code>make</code> in the directory thus created; this all worked as expected.  However, when I run <code>sudo checkinstall</code> (which invokes <code>make install</code>), things go less well.  On the first attempt the installation aborted with the following error:</p>  <pre><code>make: execvp: /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen: Permission denied make: *** [install] Error 127 </code></pre>  <p>I eventually resolved this by</p>  <pre><code>$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen </code></pre>  <p>But although a second <code>sudo checkinstall</code> then does not give the <code>execvp</code> error, it still fails at a later stage, and the log (on stdout) shows this <code>dpkg</code> error:</p>  <pre><code>dpkg: error processing /home/archelon/fujitsu-touchscreen-driver/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-112fdb75b406/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen-112fdb75b406_amd64.deb (--install):  unable to create `/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy.dpkg-new' (while processing `/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy'): No such file or directory </code></pre>  <p>And, indeed, there is no <code>/sys/module/fujitsu/usb/touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy</code>; there is, however, <code>/sys/module/fujitsu_usb_touchscreen/parameters/touch_maxy</code>, and this is presumably what was intended.  But this incorrect filename does not appear in the makefile or any other file in the directory, at least not that I can find.  Nor does it appear, as I discovered after running <code>sudo checkinstall --install=no</code> as suggested below, in the .deb package created by checkinstall.  </p>  <p>Where might such a typographical error be originating, and how would I go about fixing it?</p>  <p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> I'm viewing the contents of the .deb file with <code>ark</code>, Kubuntu's default tool.  It contains only three files: <code>control.tar.gz</code>, <code>data.tar.gz</code>, and <code>debian-binary</code>. <code>data.tar.gz</code> contains the directory tree that appears to match up to the usual root filesystem, with /etc, /lib, /sys, and /usr directories. (Looking at other .deb files on my system, this structure appears to be typical.) Here's a screenshot:<br> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/KYvaJ8f.png" alt="Ark window with contents of data.tar.gz">.<br> (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/KYvaJ8f.png" rel="nofollow">Full size</a>.)</p>  <p>Here's another screenshot showing that <code>control.tar.gz</code> contains three files, one of which is empty:<br> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/pPVpGA4.png" alt="Ark windows showing the rest of cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen_112fdb75b406-1_amd64.deb">.<br> (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/pPVpGA4.png" rel="nofollow">Full size</a>.)  </p>  <p>Here's the actual .deb file: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/odwxxez0fhyvg7a/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen_112fdb75b406-1_amd64.deb" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/odwxxez0fhyvg7a/cybergene-fujitsu-usb-touchscreen_112fdb75b406-1_amd64.deb</a></p>  <p><strong>Edited 2013-09-28 to add:</strong></p>  <p>After reinstalling Kubuntu 12.04 again, this time recreating the /home partition (which, again, had been generated during an install of 13.04), I can no longer reproduce this error.  I am still curious to know how the underscores got changed to slashes, but it looks as though nobody has any idea.  It is perhaps also of interest to note that while I have still not successfully run <code>checkinstall</code> against this package, I have done <code>make install</code>; it requires the executabilization of <code>/etc/init.d/fujitsu_touchscreen</code> and the installation of <code>hal</code>, and the GUI freezes shortly after installation completes, and there is no particular new functionality afterwards that I have noticed, and the system can no longer resume from being suspended; however, this will be pursued elsewhere.</p> 	Avidemux how to resize viedos with the H.263 Codec?<p>I want to use the H.263 Codec for my Videos with Avidemux but everytime I want to render the video from .webm to .mp4 with this Codec I get an error message that this format is not supported and the only formats it accepts are for example: 704 x 576. But when I try to find my solution in the internet many people say H.264 is the best Codec. My problem now is that I have a 1600x900 Video and want to render it with H.264 to .mp4 without resizing it. Does anybody know an answer? </p>

Users could enable it by opening Nautilus's preferences and selecting "Open each folder in its own window." Choosing this option resulted in a stripped down interface, and folders would always open in the same place on the screen. It looked something like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YjpZ0.png" alt="Image of Nautilus in spatial mode, from Colin Charles' blog post"></p>  <p>That checkbox is still there, but it doesn't do the same thing: while every folder opens in a new window, those windows are all the same size and positioned the same way. Nautilus doesn't restore the size and position of each folder, which is what spatial mode was all about. This difference really shows if someone opens a folder in a new window, and then opens the same folder again. Nautilus will create <em>another</em> window instead of focusing the existing window.</p>  <p>I help someone who is currently using Ubuntu 10.04, and he will be upgrading to 12.04 in the future. He is very comfortable with Nautilus's spatial behaviour and I think he would be disappointed to lose it. Is there an alternative file manager, or perhaps some less obvious option, that will give him an interface similar to the one he is comfortable with?</p>

I've downloaded a version of Ubuntu on their website, so I think there's little hope that the iso is the problem. I installed it in a USB flash drive.</p>  <p><strong>Version of Ubuntu : 12.04.3 desktop amd64</strong></p>  <p><strong>Software used to install the iso : Universal USB installer 1.9.5.1</strong></p>  <p><strong>My USB flash drive has 15 Go free so I don't think memory is the problem</strong></p>  <p><strong>My computer is a ASUS Republic of gamer, laptop, using Windows 7. My processor is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU Q720 with 8 Go of RAM and 64Bit</strong></p>  <p>Then, I restart, select boot from USB drive, I get into the menu of Unbuntu, where you can choose to "Use whitout installing", "Install", and the other options. I first choose use without installing, since I just want to see what it is. So, I select the choice, press "Enter", I get to a screen where's there's a little loading with the Ubuntu logo, and after a few seconds of loading I get to a pitch black screen.</p>  <p>Here's what I've tried to resolve the problem so far : </p>  <p>1 - Re-install the same .iso in my USB flash drive</p>  <p>2 - Re- download the version of Ubuntu I want to use</p>  <p>3 - When in the boot menu, try to find help in the help section, from which I didn't understand a single thing</p>  <p>4 - Scream (it didn't do anything but it made me feel good)</p>  <p>I've read that Universal USB installer might be the problem, but before finding a new software, I want to know if there's another place where it might be buggy. </p>  <p>If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate, I don't know a thing about Linux but from what I've heard, it can be a super OS and I'd hate to be stopped by a problem when trying to use it. </p>

I removed this installation with mkfs and now this partition is clean. I burned a start-up Ubuntu disc and I am trying to install it.</p>  <p>For some strange reasons ubuntu installer mounts this drive as /cdrom and I can't go on with the instalation because 'It cannot be unmounted" and "partition table cannot be altered"</p>  <p>I don't want to repartition the HDD neither to format anything. The only changes I introduced to the partition table within the installer was to set up mounting points.</p>  <p>So how to install Ubuntu in this case? I've tried a lot of different things, e.g. it doesn't help to move the HDD to another controller. So even if /dev/sda is a clean new HDD and /dev/sdb is the HDD of interest, the stupid installer still mounts it (now /dev/sdb) </p>  <p>So I did another experiment: I put a third HDD into the machine. Now it looks as follows:</p>  <ul> <li>/dev/sda1 - 1TB (irrelevant HDD with ext3 partition)</li> <li>/dev/sdb1 - 1TB with another Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit installation</li> <li>/dev/sdc1 - 1TB THE HARD DRIVE, where Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit used to be installed</li> </ul>  <p>Unfortunately even now the installer says "your installation medium is /dev/sdc1" WHY? Why there but neither on /dev/sda1 nor on /dev/sdb2???</p>  <p>Although now I have 3 HDDs, I can't play too much with them, because:</p>  <ul> <li>/dev/sdb1 holds my backup of /dev/sda1</li> <li>/dev/sdc1 is borrowed from another machine and I don't want to have yet another problem with ubuntu installation (when I would mess up /dev/sdc1)</li> </ul>  <p>I also need to keep partition table on the target drive because there are other partitions there with users' data</p>

So ideally one should be able to boot into described Linux distro from USB w/o disabling SecureBoot or enabling Legacy anything. The problem seems quite trivial, as it is not being discussed at all. What am I doing wrong? This also worries me a bit, because I was thinking of moving windows recovery to an external drive and freeing up the valuable space from my tiny SSD (and hopefully installing another OS there), and if I can't boot from USB...!! About Linux, can anyone also let me know if installing software not provided by HP voids my warranty?</p>

VNC is painfully slow with Haiku OS guest, Spice won't install and SDL doesn't work<p>I've been coming up to speed on the <a href="http://haiku-os.org/" rel="nofollow">Haiku</a> operating system, an Open Source clone of BeOS 5 Pro.</p>  <p>I'm using an Apple MacBook Pro as my development machine.  Apple's BootCamp BIOS does not support more than four partitions on the internal hard drive.  While I can set up extended and logical partitions, doing so will prevent any of the installed operating systems from booting.  To run Haiku directly on the iron, I boot it off a USB stick.  Using external storage is also helpful because I am perpetually out of filesystem space.</p>  <p>While VirtualBox is documented to allow access to physical drives, I could not actually get it to work.  Also VirtualBox can only use one of the host CPU's cores.  While VB guests can be configured for more than one CPU, they are only emulated.  A full build of the Haiku OS takes 4.5 under VB.  </p>  <p>I had the hope of reducing build times by using KVM instead, but it's not working nearly as well as VirtualBox did.  The Linux Kernel Virtual Machine is broken in all manner of fundamental ways as seen from Haiku.</p>  <p>But I'm a coder; maybe I could contribute to fixing some of those problems.</p>  <p>The first problem I've got is that Haiku's video in virt-manager is quite painfully slow.  When I drag Haiku windows around the desktop, they lag quite far behind where my mouse is.  It's quite difficult to move a window to a precise position on the screen.  Just imagine that the mouse was connected to the window title bar with a really stretchy spring.</p>  <p>Also Haiku's mouse lags quite far behind where I have moved it.</p>  <p>I found lots of Personal Package Archives that enable Spice from QEMU / KVM at the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu Personal Package Arhives</a>.  I tried a few of the PPAs but none of them worked; with one of them, the command "add-apt-repository" crashed with a traceback.</p>  <p>There is a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/spice" rel="nofollow">Wiki page about Spice</a>, but it says that it only works on 64-bit.  My Early 2006 MacBook Pro is 32-bit.  Its Apple Model Identifier is MacBookPro1,1; these use Core Duos NOT Core 2 Duos.</p>  <p>I don't mind building a source deb for 32-bit if I can expect it to work.  Is there some reason that Spice should be 64-bit only?  Does it need features of the x86_64 Instruction Set Architecture that x86 does not have?</p>  <p>When I try using SDL from virt-manager, the configuration for Local SDL Window says "Xauth: /home/mike/.Xauthority".  When I try to start my guest, virt-manager emits an error.</p>  <p>When I Googled the error message, the usual solution was to make ~/.Xauthority readible.  However, .Xauthorty does not exist in my home directory.  Instead I have a $XAUTHORITY environment variable.  There is no way to configure SDL in virt-manager to use $XAUTHORITY instead of ~/.Xauthority.  Neither does it work to copy the value of $XAUTHORITY into the file.</p>  <p>I am ready to scream, because I've been five fscking days trying to make KVM work for Haiku development.  There is a whole lot more that is broken than the slow video.</p>  <p>All I really want to do for now is speed up my full builds of Haiku by using "jam -j2" to use both cores in my CPU. </p>  <p>I may try Xen next, but the last time I monkeyed with Xen it was far, far more broken than I am finding KVM to be.</p>  <p>Just for now, I would be satisfied if there were some way to use my USB stick as a drive in VirtualBox.  VB does allow me to configure /dev/sdb as a drive, but it always causes a fatal error when I try to launch the guest.</p>  <p>Thank You For Any Advice You Can Give Me.  - </p>

So, being able to expand my development to Ubuntu making me able to develop across all platforms sounds fantastic!</p>  <p>I read on the Ubuntu site about development, and I'm downloading the Ubuntu SDK currently, but I just had some questions that the site didn't answer for me when I was looking around.</p>  <p>Is the Ubuntu SDK strictly for Ubuntu mobile, or is it for the computer OS, or both?</p>  <p>Also, I saw some tips and help guides on the Ubuntu website for Ubuntu development, but I didn't see anything I could use as a valuable resource, so is there any resource that is recommended that I should use to help assist me in Ubuntu Development?</p>  <p><em><strong>to clarify further:</em></strong> I'm currently using a Ubuntu Machine, and I also have the tools I need to develop for Ubuntu.  I would like to know if there is a difference in developing for Ubuntu Touch OS and the Ubuntu OS. Like OSX and iOS both have a core language of Objective-C, but both platforms use two different SDK's since they are two different operating systems. </p>  <p>I also would like to know of any resources to assist me, being that I'm new to these particular tools.</p>  <p>I'm not a newbie to coding, but when dealing with a new platform, it really helps to know the basics of what's going on, rather than diving right in and ending up getting tripped by something simple and trivial.</p>  <p>Again, any help is always appreciated! </p>

non-duplicate	Getting a Public IP that is different for my Ubuntu Server then my Homenetwork<p>Okay so here's the thing, I live in Sweden and got fiber with a internet speed of 100/100 mb/s. They way my network is setup right now is that I got a modem which is hooked up to my router which goes to all the computers in the house. But here's the problem, I don't want my server to have the same Public IP as my other computers in my house.</p>  <p>I've achived this before by using another old router i got and hooking it into the modem which got 10 ports, and this gave me a different Public IP. This would work perfectly for me if it wasn't that the router is pretty bad so it slows down the speed of the internet with a great amount.</p>  <p>So my guesses are to do something like to put my Server directly into the modem and not use any router at all and use some sort of program on the Server, or use some kind of setting on my router (asus RT-AC66U).</p>  <p>Those are my guesses but I really don't know how to do it, so any help would be really nice! But if there isn't any way of doing this I could get another router, but I don't feel like spending extra money on a router good enough to handle 100/100 mb/s.</p>  <p>If there are any more info that I forgot needed please point it out in the comments!

I've tried everything that I've ready (that I understand) on the site here and plenty of other sites. I've been a Linux/Ubuntu user for many years but I don't mess with Xorg or video setup in Linux very often so my experience in that area might be a bit lacking. That being said.</p>  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I have an HP Compaq desktop with an onboard video card (Intel), an NVidia card, and an ATI card. I can not get more than any one of them to work at a time however they all will work separately. I can change the default boot display in BIOS and change the one that is used but this doesn't do me much good.</p>  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> I have two monitors and I would like to run them both as an extended setup with two separate desktop spaces that I can use. I would like to run this in GNOME.</p>  <p>I've Tried: All of the different drivers I can find and think of. I don't think this is the problem tho because I can see when I list the devices that they have drivers activated but not used. I've attempted removing all drivers and only installing the XOrg ones, also tried just using Nouveau, just Nvidia, just ATI, etc... combinations of these. The <code>nvidia-settings</code> tool says that no drivers are in use so that doesn't do me any good. I've tried <code>dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org</code> which just just puts me back on Unity instead of GNOME. I can't figure out why this happens. If I delete the <code>xorg.conf</code> and reboot I do get my GNOME back.</p>  <p>The regular display control panel only shows one display no matter what I've done. The <em>additional drivers</em> panel currently has the _nvidia_96_ driver installed.

non-duplicate	What is the difference between the "start" and "start now" options in Transmission?<p>In Transmission, if you right-click on a paused torrent, you will get a menu.

I'm running Ubuntu Server 13.04, but any answers also need to work on Server 14.04. </p>  <p>I've looked at ACPI events and such, tried editing the <code>/etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh</code> and <code>/etc/acpi/events/powerbtn</code> files but no luck anywhere. </p>  <p>So then I after reading this page <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/acpid" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/acpid</a>, I ran <code>sudo journalctl -f</code> as instructed, but that didn't work. So I tried <code>sudo acpi_listen</code> and I got into the ACPI event listener. However, even from in there, pushing the power button gave me no output at all. </p>  <p>Is there another service in place which catches the power button events before ACPI? What files would I then need to edit to execute my script when the power button is pushed? </p>  <p>I've also tried <code>sudo xev</code> and that gave me no output on the power button either. </p>  <p>EDIT: I also have a Ubuntu Desktop system and on that system I can get output from ACPI and I can edit the <code>/etc/acpi</code> scripts. Is there something installed with Unity that miraculously enables ACPI?</p>  <p>EDIT AGAIN: Ended up doing a fresh install...ACPI worked. I guess I messed something up when I was experimenting and first tried to find a solution to this problem. What I did was place my python script in <code>/etc/acpi/</code> and then added the following two lines to the top of <code>/etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh</code> </p>  <pre><code>sudo python my_python_script.py exit 0 </code></pre>  <p>And it worked. Thanks guys. </p>

duplicate	Retrieving files from broken wubi installation<p>My wubi installation of Ubuntu 12.04 is stuck in an infinite login screen loop. I have tried following the advice on other posts but nothing has worked so now I'm trying to retrieve a few files from root.disk from Windows7.</p>  <p>Here is what I have tried:</p>  <p>I booted into ubuntu and when faced with the login screen ctrl+shift+F1 and logged in with that. Updated all my packages and tried to log in the usual way again. No Dice.</p>  <p>I logged in that way again and tried to copy some files over to /media/DATA (this is a general purpose windows-friendly storage partition). Permission Denied. sudo doesn't work and su wont accept my password. </p>  <p>I got into recovery mode root and opened up /media/DATA . ls tells me that it is empty (it is not). I made a new folder for my backups. This new folder shows up with ls. cp started the copy without complaint but then I ran out of disk space on DATA. I booted into Windows and the backups directory isn't where I left it and I have loads of space left. Back in recovery mode the backup folder is still visible but nothing else on DATA is... spooky.</p>  <p>My next approach was to find something that I could use to open up root.disk via windows. I have seen lots of recommendations for programs on this forum but they either dont work on windows7, only have corrupted versions available for download, or just wont open the .disks as is.</p>  <p>So my question is:</p>  <p>How can I make data stored in a wubi disk image available to Windows7?</p> 	moving files from ubuntu to windows<p>I installed Ubuntu with Wubi.exe in (E:) and want to move all files in (D: for example) in windows,how to do it?

It can see both but can't connect, just keeps trying to connect.</p>  <p>Any help on either issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <pre><code>$ sudo lshw -c network    *-network                       -description: Wireless interface        -product: RT3290 Wireless 802.11n 1T/1R PCIe        -vendor: Ralink corp.        -physical id: 0        -bus info: pci@0000:08:00.0        -logical name: wlan0        -version: 00        -serial: 54:35:30:80:eb:01        -width: 32 bits        -clock: 33MHz        -capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless        -configuration: broadcast=yes driver=rt2800pci driverversion=3.13.0-29-generic firmware=0.37 latency=0 link=no multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn        resources: irq:18 memory:c2610000-c261ffff   *-network        description: Ethernet interface        product: RTL8101E/RTL8102E PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller        vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.        physical id: 0        bus info: pci@0000:09:00.0        logical name: eth0        version: 08        serial: a0:1d:48:e4:ff:c4        size: 100Mbit/s        capacity: 100Mbit/s        width: 64 bits        clock: 33MHz        capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation        configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full firmware=rtl8106e-2_0.0.1 04/23/13 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=100Mbit/s        resources: irq:59 ioport:4000(size=256) memory:c2504000-c2504fff memory:c2500000-c2503fff  $ ifconfig -a eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a0:1d:48:e4:ff:c4             inet6 addr: fe80::a21d:48ff:fee4:ffc4/64 Scope:Link           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1           RX packets:36631 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0           TX packets:189 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0           collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000            RX bytes:2200377 (2.2 MB)  TX bytes:38826 (38.8 KB)  lo        Link encap:Local Loopback             inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0           inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host           UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1           RX packets:191 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0           TX packets:191 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0           collisions:0 txqueuelen:0            RX bytes:13717 (13.7 KB)  TX bytes:13717 (13.7 KB)  wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 54:35:30:80:eb:01             UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1           RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0           TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0           collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000            RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B) </code></pre>  <p>I figured it out.

non-duplicate	Is it possible to use the conditional arguments in a preseed?<p>I am trying to create a preseed.cfg that is usable for a CD based installation and a network based installation.  I figured the easiest way to do this would be to use a bash conditional "if".  As part of preseed/late I have something similar to the following.</p>  <pre><code>d-i preseed/late_command string \ if [ -f "/media/cdrom/pool/extras/info.gz" ];\     then\         echo "CD Install Info";\          cp /media/cdrom/pool/extras/info.gz /target/var/www/info.gz;\     else\         echo "Assuming Network install";\          wget http://192.168.0.1/info.gz;\          cp ./info.gz /target/var/www/info.gz;\ fi </code></pre>  <p>Which fails with an error saying that "fi is expected".  I figured this was an issue with the parser so I condensed everything onto one line.</p>  <pre><code>if [ -f "media/cdrom/pool/extras/info.gz" ]; cp /media/cdrom/pool/extras/info.gz /target/var/www/info.gz; fi </code></pre>  <p>This command finishes without an error, but the file is not copied.  After many attempts using different syntax I began to wonder if this is even possible.  So is it possible to use conditionals (if there are others besides if I should try let me know) during preseed/late?</p> 	How can I change the window movement key when using Unity 2D?<p>The default window movement key (alt) conflicts with several programs that I use fairly often.

I created a bootable USB using Pen Drive linux installer (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows</a>) (12.10) and put a clean install on a separate partition that I created on my main HDD. Now when I boot from Grub it just goes to a black screen. </p>  <p>Hardware: Lenovo Y410p - intel core i7 and an nvidia card. I don't really care about getting the nvidia card working, I've been focused on just getting integrated graphics going. </p>  <p>What I've tried: for the most part I have been using suggestions from this article (<a href="http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/842" rel="nofollow">http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/842</a>). So I have tried <code>nomodeset</code>, <code>i915.modeset=0</code> and various others. Most simply boot to a black screen. If I include <code>nomodeset</code> and <code>grub_gfxmode=1024x768x16</code> I get dropped to a command line, If I use the native resolution of the monitor I get a black screen. From the command line I took a look at my Xorg.0.log and a snippet is below, I can include the full version if you think it will help but this appears to be where it goes awry. </p>  <pre><code>    [

I assumed it was just RAM problem, so I canceled the copying, since it wasn't actually important. The glitch remained, and so did another; very slow response time. The mouse moved just fine, but windows were waiting about a minute after I hit the x button to close or even switch active window.

duplicate	Parallel Installation of Ubuntu, Wubi and Windows 7?<p>I have Windows 7 installed on a Notebook. Because I wanted to experiment with Ubuntu without loosing my Windows 7 configuration I installed the Wubi Version of Ubuntu inside of Windows 7. Since things seam to work out well with Ubuntu and my harddisk space is very limited, I want to make Ubuntu my only operating system on this machine. So my question is:</p>  <p><strong>Is it possible, to install Ubuntu 11.04 additionally to my actual configuration (Wubi and Windows 7)? And if things turned out well with the native installation of Ubuntu, too, to delete Wubi and Windows 7 from my system afterwards?</strong></p>  <p>Why I am asking this is simply, that I am afraid, that if I just format my machine and made the whole harddisk available for the fresh Ubuntu installation, it could be possible, that it turns out, that one thing or an other would not work properly, like it did in Wubi. (Possible Network, VPN, and Firewall@work issues) In this case I'd like the possibility to switch back.</p> 	Make a new storage spot and install windows<p>My question is how to make a new storage spot and install windows 7(64 bit).

non-duplicate	Speed up Banshee's indexing of files on a device<p>I've got an external hard drive with music on it, around 250 albums.  To make it work nicely with Banshee, I've created an <code>.is_audio_player</code> file on the device, containing <code>audio_folders=Music</code>.</p>  <p>Every time I plug it in, Banshee takes around two minutes to index the thing, slowly building up the library - and being unusably sluggish while doing that.</p>  <p>Is there, per chance, any way to speed it up?

It is Intel graphics combined with Nvidia GeForce GT650M. I tried Bumblebee, but primusrun doesn't work (segmentation fault, core dumped) and optirun works with glxspheres64, but steam games look worse with optirun than with Intel graphics (e.g. Surgeon Simulator 2013 runs fine with Intel and hangs a lot with optirun) </p>  <p>I tried Nvidia Prime, but it gives me a black screen on startup after install, so I can't do anything and have to power off my PC with the power button.

non-duplicate	Video stutter when using external drive<p>When using boxee to play video files off of an external western digital 1TB drive formatted NTFS, I notice a slight stutter in the video every 5-10 seconds.  When using mplayer, it doesn't stutter as often, but it still stutters occasionally.  If I play the video off of the local sata drive, it plays fine even in boxee.  I use this computer as my HTPC and I just switched from windows to linux on it.  In windows, I never had any sort of stutter playing movies from the drive.  I am using the latest intel graphics drivers (for the intel GMA 950)</p>  <pre><code>root@eee-htpc:/home/htpc# grep wd /etc/mtab /dev/sdb1 /mnt/wd2 fuseblk rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=512 0 0 </code></pre>  <p>I notice that despite trying to use ntfs or ntfs-3g, ubuntu uses ntfs-fuse which I've heard is slower. </p>  <pre><code>/dev/sdb1: Timing buffered disk reads:   80 MB in  3.07 seconds =  26.08 MB/sec  root@eee-htpc:/mnt/wd2# dd if=/dev/zero of=./120mb bs=1024 count=120000 root@eee-htpc:/mnt/wd2# time mv ./120mb /home/htpc  real    0m2.095s user    0m0.016s sys     0m0.736s </code></pre>  <p>Even though fuse has a reputation for being slow, it should easily be fast enough for playing standard definition video files.</p>  <p>So why the video stutter?</p>  <p>edit: The issue seems to be overhead cpu usage from either playing off of a usb device or ntfs/fuse.  Watching CPU usage with top, local files use 10-40% CPU.  Watching the same video on the external formatted ntfs, it spikes to 170% (over 100% because of hyperthreading).  To me it seems like it must be overhead from the fuse driver, though I don't know if it has more or less overhead than ntfs-3g.</p>  <p>It's a EEEBox B202 that has an atom 270, so not exactly the most powerful out there.</p>  <p>edit2: I believe the solution would be to use non-fuse drivers or different fuse drivers.  so far I have not been able to.</p>  <p>edit3: I've probably edited this more times than I should, but as an update I have upgraded ntfs drivers to <em>ntfs-3g 2010.8.8 external FUSE 28 - Third Generation NTFS Driver</em> using the following PPA - <code>ppa:x3lectric/team-iquik-releases</code>.  When first opening a video file in boxee that's on ntfs there's still the same amount of lag.  After a few minutes of video, the lag seems to go away and the cpu usage comes down to 10-40%.  Every so often though, it begins to stutter again.  Also, if I skip ahead/back in the file, it begins to stutter a lot.</p> 	How to compile C++ source code ("iostream.h not found" error)?<p>I do not want to discuss about C++ or any programming language!I just want to know what am i doing wrong with linux ubuntu about compiling helloworld.cpp! </p>  <p>I am learning C++ so my steps are:</p>  <p>open hello.cpp in vim and write this </p>  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt; int main() {     cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!\n";`     return 0; } </code></pre>  <p>So, after that i tried in the terminal this </p>  <pre><code>g++ hello.cpp </code></pre>  <p>AND the output is </p>  <pre><code>hello.cpp:1:22: fatal error: iostream.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated. </code></pre>  <p>What do you suggest?

non-duplicate	What to do when my system freezes?<p>Ubuntu has suddenly stopped working and everything has become unresponsive, including the mouse, keyboard. I waited for almost an hour to make it settle itself. Finally, I had to shut it down and restart it and then it was ok. </p>  <p>details: </p>  <p>When this happened, I opened almost 9 tabs (i don't know whether this can cause          a crash in ubuntu). I have Ubuntu installed in windows 8 using Wubi. I never had this problem before. I use 12.04 LTS.</p>  <p>What might be the possible reason for this? Is this due to some mis-management of system?

non-duplicate	VirtualBox release key after a few seconds<p>I am using Ubuntu in VirtualBox and it works pretty fine, but there is a problem that I am having since I started using it. I use Emacs and therefore, I use a lot of combinations/shortcuts/bindings all the time. The problem is that when I press and hold a key, for instance, CTRL for searching (Ctrl+s), if I want to keep looking I just hold it, but in this VirtualMachine after a few seconds the CTRL key is released (without me releasing it) and I finish writing a bunch of 's', in this case. Another simpler example would be, changing windows with Alt+Tab, after a while Alt is released and I end up pressing just Tab in the last window changed. I  guess this has something to do with some kind of refreshing of the peripherals or something, but it is really annoying. </p>  <p>Any ideas on how to solve it?</p>  <p>Thanks a lot!</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>Murphy's Law working here. I have been having this issue for the last 3 months (since I started working with this virtual machine), but suddenly when I asked this question I works just fine. I guess I'll have to ask more often :) Anyway, I don't think this will last forever, so if anyone has any idea about why this is happening and how to avoid it, it would be great!</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>  <p>I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

See picture:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/A6wQT1T.jpg" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu boot fails when listing CPU frequencies</a></p>  <p>The boot fails with the following screen with the verbose option in grub:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ua0rAI9.jpg" rel="nofollow">Processor context corrput</a></p>  <p>I have tried to load Stresslinux, but it would only boot in failsafe mode and it lists <strong>cpufreq</strong> as a service that failed to load.</p>  <p>I was wondering if that service can be disabled when booting via grub, but I didn't find a proper answer (somebody mentioned CPUFREQ=off for another Linux distro, but that didn't work for me).</p>  <p>I've already tested the memory with MemTest86 and it completed successfully a couple of times.</p>  <p>I'm not a Linux pro and I'm out of ideas.</p>

I wanted to boot into my fresh Ubuntu install but before the splash screen appeared a sold purple screen was shown with no text.</p>  <p>I waited about 10 mins but to no avail, then I restarted and it happened again, I went into kernel editing in GRUB and deleted thoese 2 words <code>quiet</code> and another one which I forgot! I replaced it with <code>vesa</code> and some other stuff but again it didn't work, I tried WUBI and this happened again.</p>  <p>The only way to run Ubuntu on my machine is inside a Virtual Machine which doesn't work as a solution for me because I don't want to test Ubuntu, i want to use it! Some say it's a problem with my GPU. My GPU is a Radeon HD 6950.</p> 
non-duplicate	Plugins missing in Firefox 4 whith dual 3.6 & 4 installed<p>I have installed both Firefox 3.6 and 4 in my 10.04 x64 ubuntu, I just downloaded the .tar.gz from the firefox page and started it up using a different firefox profile so it didn't share file between firefox versions. Now I have been unable to use the 3.6 plugins on the 4 install, I managed to install flash using flash-aid, but now I want to use the gmail voice plugin which works without problem on 3.6 but is never recognized as installed on 4. in what folder is Firefox 4 looking for the plugins? is there an extra step to register the plugins besides creating a symbolic link to the .so file?</p> 	"load kernel" error on USB boot?<p>I followed these instructions:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows</a></p>  <p>When I try to boot from bios into ubuntu it asks if I want to try without installing (yes, that's exactly what I'm trying to do)</p>  <p>It then tells me a file is missing and I need to load the kernel first.</p>  <p>I see others have asked similar questions but no clear answers for a noob. I've never used any form of linux before.</p>  <p>Am I doing something wrong somewhere or do those instructions not work? </p>  <p>Thanks </p>

I've done a lot of googling and I gather there's a lot of issues with Broadcom cards, but some of the answers are for earlier ubuntu builds and many of them are a bit confusing for a new user.

One functionality though that seems to be missing is the MONITOR MIXER function, which essentially was an available input bus that could be recorded like the other physical inputs (HW 1+2 and HW 3+4). This way anything running through the master out could be recorded, making it a great utility for recording anything off the web, or running application. </p>  <p>I only noticed that it was missing from the Mudita24 panel when I attempted to choose the MONITOR input using SOundfroge in Wine. Can anyone tell me if there is a way to activate this feature that was available with the Windows drivers or if there is an ubuntu application that will access this feature?</p>  <p>i have read <a href="http://alsa.opensrc.org/Envy24control" rel="nofollow">THIS</a> which mentions the MONITOR MIXER, but I still can not access the input in Soundforge. May this be a limitation of Wine? Aslo is there another sound application I could use to record with in Ubuntu (not Wine) to test this out?</p>

non-duplicate	How do I stop all processes in a chroot?<p>I have a number of LVM partitions, each containing an Ubuntu installation. Occasionally, I want to do an <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code>, to update an installation to the most recent packages. I do this with chroot - the process is usually something like:</p>  <pre><code>$ sudo mount /dev/local/chroot-0 /mnt/chroot-0 $ sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 sh -c 'apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade' $ sudo umount /mnt/chroot-0 </code></pre>  <p>[ not shown: I also mount and unmount <code>/mnt/chroot-0/{dev,sys,proc}</code> as bind-mounts to the real <code>/dev</code>, <code>/sys</code> and <code>/proc</code>, as the dist-upgrade seems to expect these to be present ]</p>  <p>However, after upgrading to precise, this process no longer works - the final umount will fail because there are still open files on the <code>/mnt/chroot-0</code> filesystem. <code>lsof</code> confirms that there are processes with open files in the chroot. These processes have been started during the dist-upgrade, I'm assuming this is because certain services in the chroot need to be restarted (eg, through <code>service postgresql restart</code>) after the package is upgraded.</p>  <p>So, I figure I need to tell upstart to stop all the services that are running within this chroot. Is there a way to reliably do this?</p>  <p>I've tried:</p>  <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 /bin/sh # stop 'initctl' services  initctl list | awk '/start\/running/ {print \$1}' | xargs -n1 -r initctl stop EOF </code></pre>  <p>Where <code>initctl list</code>  seems to do the right thing and only list processes that have been started in this particular root. I've tried adding this too, as suggested by Tuminoid:</p>  <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 /bin/sh # stop 'service' services service --status-all 2&gt;/dev/null |     awk '/^ \[ \+ \]/ { print \$4}' |     while read s; do service \$s stop; done EOF </code></pre>  <p>However, these doesn't seem to catch everything; processes that have daemonised and been reparented to PID 1 don't get stopped. I've also tried:</p>  <pre><code>sudo chroot /mnt/chroot-0 telinit 0 </code></pre>  <p>But in this case, init <em>doesn't</em> distinguish between the separate roots and shuts down the entire machine.</p>  <p>So, is there any way to tell init to stop all processes in a particular chroot, so that I can safely unmount the filesystem? Does upstart have any facility to SIGTERM/SIGKILL all child processes (as would be done during regular shutdown) within a chroot?</p> 	How do I convert music between formats and keep its metadata?<p>I tried to use Sound Converter to convert several folders of files from .m4a to .mp3 format and lost all file metadata in the conversion.

non-duplicate	How to start freecell, installed from software center<p>Freecell Solitarire won't load on Ubuntu 13.04. In the software center it appears as Installed but doesn't appear in Search.</p>  <p>Uninstalling and reinstalling did not help.</p>  <p>As a workaround,  would it be possible to start FreeCell from Terminal and then make a shortcut on it to my desktop.</p>  <p>What command do I use to start a prrogram/application from Terminal? Or is there a better way?</p> 	Suddenly nothing appears on Ubuntu except Desktop background; Also super key, alt+tab has stopped working<p>This is my weirdest experience with Ubuntu. I had upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04 many weeks back. Till y'day night everything was fine. When I started my PC today morning, weird things are happening:</p>  <ol> <li>"Alt + Tab" is not working at all, it appears as of only "Tab" is taken; I am able to open terminal using "Ctrl + Alt + Tab" (shortcut) though and move between workspaces using "Alt + Tab + <code>&lt;arrow&gt;</code>"</li> <li>"super" (which has <code>windows</code> logo) key is not working. Typically when I press it, it displays "start menu" kind of stuff</li> <li>It doesn't show anything on the screen except the background; Generally I used to see top bar where apps like skype, date/time, power setting etc. used to reside</li> <li>Not able to see left side app bar, which displays several icons when mouse hovers on it or "super" key is pressed</li> </ol>  <p>I restarted my laptop but no luck. Presently I am going to terminal and opening everything using command line, e.g. "google-chrome &amp;" and "eclipse &amp;", which is very annoying.</p>  <p>I haven't touched any of my settings in several days or install any updates, except y'day I did "sudo updatedb" just to update the <code>locate</code> command. Please someone help in this regard.</p> 
non-duplicate	Can I change where my /home folder is located?<p>I want to make my /home folder on a separate partition on my harddrive. How can I do that, if there is a way?</p> 	How to manually set color of Unity Panel?<p>I was just wondering if there's a way to set the color of the Unity panel manually, as opposed to having it derived from smooshing all the colors of the wallpaper together. (the launcher on the left side of the screen that comes default in Ubuntu <em>is</em> the Unity Panel, right? If not, please correct me on my terminology.)</p>  <p>The reason I want this is because I have this <a href="https://r8zr.deviantart.com/gallery/#/dugqxc" rel="nofollow">cool wallpaper</a> I found on DeviantArt, and I used GIMP to make Dawn, Dusk, and Midnight versions of it. Then, I set them with a transition effect, so that the lighting changes over the course of the day. Unfortunately, the Unity Panel turns a sickly sewer green at night (it could also be said to look like radioactive barf.) Either way, I don't like my launcher thingy looking like that.<br> I'd prefer to stay away from <em>programs</em> that let you customise the Unity Panel (I'm fine with using <code>sudo nano</code> to edit system config files,) but I would if it were the only option.</p>  <p>Here are some screenshots, one with a grey-themed wallpaper, one with lots of red, and the hill at night, (the one that makes the unity panel look like radioactive barf.): <a href="http://imgur.com/a/0Gqcd" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/0Gqcd</a></p> 
non-duplicate	Problem mounting my internal hard drive...any suggestions?<p>I'm a beginner with Ubuntu, booting it via usb in order to see if I can recover files from my hard drive after a crash.  I clicked on my hard drive in order to mount it, and got "Unable to mount 151 GB Filesystem" as the title of an error message.  It then goes on to say:</p>  <p>Error mounting: mount exited with exit code 13: ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread</p>  <p>failed: Input/output error</p>  <p>Failed to read NTFS $Bitmap: Input/output error</p>  <p>NTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware.  In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows then reboot into Windows twice.  The usage of the /f parameter is very important!  If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory (e.g. /dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1).  Please see the 'dmraid' documentation for more details.*</p>  <p>Does this indicate a total hard drive failure, or is there a way to correct this error and access my files?

Windows 7 isn't showing up<p>I have Windows 7 loaded onto my computer. I have never used Ubuntu before and decided to do a dual boot. I installed it as a dual boot and I had the installer create the partition (I did not create it myself). When I booted it up, it shows Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7. I could access both, but Ubuntu's display was too big for my screen. I found a page that said to enter: 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.' I did both and restarted. I got the black screen whenever I loaded Ubuntu, but I could still access Windows 7. I then put the install disk back in and said to reinstall Ubuntu with all settings staying the same. Now when I boot I get to the menu, and all Ubuntu options are there, but Windows 7 is not. I looked on the hard drive and Windows 7 is still there. I need help keeping the Ubuntu settings as is, and brining Windows 7 back to the boot menu. Thank you!</p>

That is, if the terminal window is between 31 and 40 lines, it will scroll four lines at a time. If it's 100 lines, it will scroll 10 lines at a time. How can I force it to work like other applications, <strong>scrolling N lines regardless of the window height?</strong></p>

I've researched for a very long time (probably missed something). I would really appreciate some help.  I have a Toshiba Satellite with Windows 8 pre-installed. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and used unetbootin to burn it to my USB. I disabled "Secure Boot" from the UEFI. I changed the settings in the UEFI to make the USB boot first. I'll get to the screen where it gives me the option to: 1. Try Ubuntu without installing. 2. Intall Ubuntu. 3. Check the disc for errors.  If I select either option 1 or 2, I get a blank screen and my computer just sits there and runs. Nothing happens. I have a feeling this has something to do with either the graphics card on the computer or the UEFI screwing me over. I don't think it will allow me to do "nomodeset" or anything like that. I've checked the md5 sum and it's correct. What should I do?</p>

The web app loads perfectly from any computer in the web. I do have the problem that I cant access the internet from the server itself, I open the web browser and does not load, but yet the server is accessible from the web, maybe this is a configuration from my ISP, Ive been looking for an explanation but still havent found one.

But now my public ip wont load the webapp. </p>  <p>The USB dongle is connected to a Wireless Router which has access to the internet. My ethernet card is connected to a switch provided by my ISP where I connect my other servers to get a Public IP.

non-duplicate	How do I get my bluetooth, wifi, and touchpad working again with Ubuntu 13.04?<p>So I just recently upgraded to 13.04 in the hopes that it would be friendlier to my newer PC's hardware (mainly I was hoping my dual monitor would work). Sadly after install I realized that less is working with the new version. At the moment the wifi is the biggest deal (I can use a mouse and usually don't use bluetooth). With my wifi, I am able to see the connection I want (maybe from my previous version of Ubuntu that I upgraded from) but I am not able to connect. In fact, I can't even see this "Enable Wi-Fi" option that people speak of. It just isn't there. I am at a loss and don't want to give up on Ubuntu because it is great when it works but I seem to be spending more time fixing than I spend working. Not sure if this matters but I have an Alienware M-14x with an Nvidia GeForce GT 650M and an i7 processor (but Ubuntu is using my crappy integrated card at the moment).</p> 	Qemu KVM VNC Support<p>Do I need to install a special package to get the VNC support ?</p>  <p>I installed:</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get install kvm qemu-kvm qemu-kvm-extras </code></pre>  <p>Everything works fine, I only get no VNC server up and running, although its configured for the VM.</p>  <p>Maybe this is a firewall problem since I can connect locally.</p>

I have tried CTRL-ALT F5, CTRL-ALT-F4 and so on and this leads to nothing - no login prompts.  The only solution is to reboot.  I <em>can</em> ssh into the machine and get a terminal that way using this user though so that is a big plus.</p>  <p>So even though this is happening, the GUEST account works perfectly fine.  I can just click it and it will login to the GUI no problem.</p>  <p>What could cause the guest account to work with the GUI and my user account to give me a black screen after my username/password is entered?  And more importantly, how can I fix this?</p>

First of all, I've heard that problems with ubuntu on <strong>toshiba satellite</strong> laptops often occur. Don't know whether it has something with toshiba drivers or something else, but there are other operational systems facing the problem when installed on a toshiba laptops.</p>  <p>I am using a <a href="http://www.toshiba.com/us/computers/laptops/satellite/C850/C855-S5345" rel="nofollow">toshiba satellite c855-2gd</a>. With its system components, I see no reason for ubuntu being dysfunctional. </p>  <p>However at times, when I download an app from Ubuntu Software Center, during the installation my side and top panel just disappear. Then I am unable to do anything ( not even open terminal via ctrl+alt+T ) but to go for that black screen on crtl+alt+f6 and reboot my system. Then my panels are back but I'm bit frustrated that my panels are often missing. Just a few moments ago, I downloaded a presentation ( pptx format ) and it happened again! And it happened a week ago when I was transmitting data from my USB to my laptop...</p>  <p>Once I managed to install a wine application on my ubuntu, I tried to run the old game ( Diablo 1 ) and the whole system crashed!</p>  <p>Can someone please tell me what to do to prevent such problems in future? And would it somehow help if I upgrade to ubuntu 13.10 ? Perhaps there are some features in 13.10 release that I don't know of and could help with this annoying panel problem?</p>

They are needed for the Adobe Air installer to proceed properly. I need to be able to execute this command to get the .deb to work, which should also give me what I need for the normal installer as well:</p>  <pre><code>sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 libnss3-1d:i386 libnspr4-0d:i386 lib32nss-mdns libxml2:i386 libxslt1.1:i386 </code></pre>  <p>However, doing so yields a mystifying error about not being able to find said packages:</p>  <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 libnss3-1d:i386 libnspr4-0d:i386 lib32nss-mdns libxml2:i386 libxslt1.1:i386 Reading package lists...

non-duplicate	SSD cache for Lenovo Y500<p>I have a Lenovo Y500 with a dual GTX650M, 16Gb SSD and 1Tb HDD.</p>  <p>I just install a clean Ubuntu 13.04 then upgrade to 13.10. Previously I had windows 8 but I cleaned it off and only use Ubuntu 13.10 since then.</p>  <p>What I'm trying to ask is that: </p>  <p>Is there any SSD cache out of the box for Ubuntu 13.10 or do I have to manually enable them by using flashcache/dm-cache/bache/etc ?</p>  <p>My current setting of SSD in my BIOS is AHCI and Y500 AFAIK doesn't have RAID option. So is there anything I can do to have an alternative to Intel Smart Response technology that is available in Windows 8?</p>  <p>Lastly, would it be better if I just install /root on the SSD with /home on HDD? Will there be any performance improvement using this set-up instead of SSD Cache?</p>  <p>Thank you in advance for your help. Since I'm very new to Ubuntu, some links to existing tutorials or informations will be so much appreciated. </p> 	Untrusted application launcher?<p>Some time ago, Ubuntu introduced a Security "feature", that would only allow trusted .desktop apps to be run, on other apps it would pop up a message.</p>  <p>Nothing new so far, However, said Message used to have a button to make the app "trusted", but that button doesn't exist anymore:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pSVrr.png" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>What's the point of this dialog?</p> 
non-duplicate	ThrottleStop for Ubuntu?<p>I was able to install and dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04 (both x64) just a while ago. As a newbie in Ubuntu, I'm still searching for ways to install my games because I'm planning to make Ubuntu my main OS because it's like really cool and smooth and uses less resources.</p>  <p>So, I was wondering if there are softwares that are similar to ThrottleStop. I need it because my Laptop throttles upon reaching 75C (processor). I play heavy games so, I need to stop it from throttling. Of course I'm not trying to kill my laptop. I adjust my multiplier so that it wont reach as much as 95C. Nothing much I can do. I'm just making the most out of my Laptop since I can't buy a new one yet. I don't have a job :| I'm still just a student.</p>  <p>Anyways, Is there any software similar to ThrottleStop so that I can adjust the multiplier and disable throttling.</p> 	How to monitor my wireless network?<p>Does anyone know how to find out who using my network other than me in ubuntu?

duplicate	How can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows?<p>I need my pre-installed version of Windows 7 (or any other version of Windows), how could I install Ubuntu without erasing it?</p> 	Confusing when installing on windows 7<p>I have an ACER ASPIRE V3-571G with Windows 7,INTEL Core i5. It has the usual bootable partition. I want to install a version of Ubuntu. I had a trial run some days ago and when the install asked me to choose where to install I could not figure out which was the C:/ drive or the partition. I want to keep the Windows 7 recovery partition just in case I want to sell this laptop and get me a better one later on and install ubuntu over Windows 7... ie there is a partition that ACER created to house the recovery software. Then there is the c:\ drive that the OS is installed on so I want to blitz the C:\ drive and install ubuntu but keep the recovery partition. How easy is this to do?</p>  <p>Hope this makes sense Regards David</p>

Firstly I use Ubuntu on an old laptop and happy with it. I understand new release is better suitable for better HW, RAM etc; secondly on Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, 12.10 there were issues I have spent a long time to fix for ATI driver, for internet connection etc. the speed result is still not better compared to 11.04.</p>  <p>No, I am not looking for any fix. I just want to know: I like to use latest graphic driver ATI on the desktop PC, can I stick with Ubuntu 11.04? How can I upgrade application security without moving up from the stable 11.04 Ubuntu system? </p> 
non-duplicate	How to add "exotic" keyboard layouts on Ubuntu?<p>Checking the <code>load-extra-items</code> at <code>org.gnome.libgnomekbd.desktop</code> (via a.g. <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/dconf-editor" rel="nofollow">dconf-editor</a> [<img src="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/1009995" alt="Install dconf-editor](http://hostmar.co/software-large)](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/dconf-editor) ) should theoretically do the trick.

Can anyone help me with some walkaround (I'd like to enable the <code>Polish (international with accents)</code> keyboard layout).</p> 	Limit the parallelisation of Upstart?<p>If I understand right, Upstart runs all tasks that are ready to run in parallel.</p>  <p>However, is there a way to limit the amount of parallelisation? That is, the number of parallel tasks that are run should be capped by some constant.</p>  <p>For example, <code>make</code> allows you to run all tasks in parallel with the <code>-j</code> option. If you want to restrict the amount of parallel jobs, you can pass a number to it. Thus, <code>-j 2</code> means run jobs in parallel but not more than two at a time.</p>  <p>I am looking for the equivalent setting in upstart.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> I just realized that my question is silly. If the jobs are daemons that never stop, then there is no way for Upstart to decide that they are done. Instead, what I need is a way to limit by disk i/o. That is, when disk i/o is high, upstart shouldn't spawn new jobs. It should only spawn after disk activity cools down.</p>

Because I prefer the Chrome browser, I've also installed Google Chrome stable (Version 35.0.1916.114). Everything has worked smoothly for the last couple months, but last night video stopped working on all websites. When I switch to Firefox, videos "sometimes" play, but are stopping frequently. I've researched similar issues on this forum and others, but none of the solutions provided (clearing browser data/caches, opening windows in incognito mode, making sure I have an updated Shockwave flashplayer version and that no other flashplayers or media players are interfering, making sure the chrome browser is updated, have worked. I've even uninstalled and re-installed the chrome browser, and have also reset the browser, but it still won't play videos.</p>  <p>When I go to YouTube, or any other site with imbedded video for that matter, it will play the video for what seems a millisecond, but not play past that part. There is NO white/gray/black screen or anything else. It simply stops after I first start the video. What is interesting is that when I switch from Ubuntu back to the default Chromebook, videos play fine. So I'm thinking this may be an Ubuntu issue. Unfortunately, I'm unfamiliar with diagnosing driver issues, if that is the problem. I should also add that internet speed is fine. No issues there.</p>

I have copied this folder to <code>/opt/ZendStudio</code>, and I can launch the program using <code>/opt/ZendStudio/ZendStudio</code> but in the Unity Launcher it shows up with a grey box and a big Question Mark as it's icon.</p>  <p>However, I'd like it to be show up in the Applications list so I can search for it and load it like a normal application. </p>  <p>I also want to Pin it to the launcher so it stays there the whole time, and I tried this with running it directly but it didn't work and it didn't load up the application icon.</p>  <p>Any ideas how I can finish the install so it is in my menus etc?</p> 	Can't access Ubuntu after I installed windows<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sFDGs.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>So What I did to dual boot was split a partion from my Ubuntu section.

non-duplicate	Brightness Hotkeys Only Slightly Work<p>I just installed Precise on my Samsung Laptop (QX412-S01au, using Ubuntu 2D).  The brightness hotkeys sort of work:</p>  <ul> <li>Adjusting the brightness using the slider in the control panel works just fine</li> <li>Pressing the brightness keys brings up the brightness notification</li> <li>Pressing "Up" raises the brightness to maximum, no matter what it was before</li> <li>Pressing "Down" lowers the brightness to one step below maximum, no matter what it was before.</li> </ul>  <p>Another answer I looked (can't find the link, sorry) got my to try this:</p>  <pre><code>echo "0" | sudo tee /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness </code></pre>  <p>which takes the brightness to the lowest setting.

I upgraded my 13.04 to 13.10 and everything appeared to upgrade flawlessly. At the end, I rebooted and was able to use Logitech K260 keyboard to type in my password and get to the desktop screen.  From that point on, 13.10 would not get any input from the keyboard, however the mouse works well. Before I upgraded to 13.10, I, a few months ago, did a fresh install of 13.10 on a different partition.  I am using that installation of 13.10 to write this. So, something is wrong with the upgrade as there are two bootable partitions, one working, and one not. I would appreciate any help with this.

duplicate	What is taking up so much space on my disk, beside the filesystem?<p>I have only one disk in my computer, a 80 GB SSD. It is formatted as a single ext4 partition (no swap), and all the usual folders are installed on it (I keep lots of data on external media, but /home and all the rest is on the SSD). </p>  <p>Today I booted it and I got a message that the drive is full. I opened Disk Usage Analyzer to look at what takes up space. It insists that 67.8 GB of the disk are used, and that / is taking up 36.4 GB. Which leads to the question, where are the missing 30 GB, if not on the file system?!  </p>  <p>Just to have a comparison, I added up all the sizes of all readable folders listed in Nautilus as subfolders of / (including the hidden ones). I got 20.9 GB. Trash was unreadable, but I know it has 16.2 GB, so the sum is 36.1 GB, around the same as what Disk Usage Analyzer is reporting. There were some system folders which were unreadable, like proc, but I doubt that they add up to 30 GB - else it wouldn't be possible to install Ubuntu on small disks, and I've seen it run on 2.5 GB. I think they must be the 0.3 GB difference between my calculation and the Disk Usage Analyzer's report. </p>  <p>So I'd like to know, what is eating up these 30 GB and how do I get it to free them? </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YyZBF.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p><strong>Edit with answers to CYREX's questions</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Booted from Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit live CD (same as my system).</li> </ol>  <p>fsck result: </p>  <pre> root@ubuntu:~# fsck /dev/sda1 fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2 e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010) /dev/sda1: clean, 265956/4890624 files, 18073343/19537408 blocks </pre>  <ol> <li>Booted from the SDD.

I have tried using the command 'winetricks dotnet40', but it says that I need to switch the wineprefix to 32-bit.

I now want to get rid of the Win 8 RC, then add that partition space to my Ubuntu partition, but have no idea how to accomplish this.</p>  <p>Do I need to uninstall Win 8 RC from within Windows first? The grub loader sends me to the Win 8 loader, where I have Win 7 as the default.

I sent the computer to the lab, and they claimed everything is ok with the hardware. They installed Windows 7 and showed me everything is fine, as seen here: </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OFOGG.jpg" alt="Windows 7 Display Menu"></p> 	Can't boot after package updates (upgrade included 3.0.0-14 kernel upgrade)<p>I upgraded my system today (usual minor package updates), and have not been able to boot into any 3-0-0-XX kernel since, despite the fact that I was using a 3.0 kernel just fine before today. I checked for questions that covered my problem and I found <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/86684/after-updating-kernel-to-3-0-0-14-the-system-does-not-boot">this question</a>, and I tried the solution, but was still unable to boot. I've also checked for solutions in the Ubuntu bug database but I haven't been able to get any of them to work.</p>  <p>When I boot 3.0.0-14 (or -12 or -13) in recovery, all I get is a line like</p>  <pre><code>rtc_cmos 00:05: setting system clock to &lt;blah&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and nothing happens after that. There's no response to keyboard input, including Ctrl-Alt-Delete.</p>  <p>Does anyone know a solution to this problem? I'm booting in an old 2.6.38 kernel for now, but this will start getting obnoxious after I forget that I have to do this.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>The system is indeed totally unresponsive to keyboard input. Neither the Magic SysRq keys nor the Ctrl-Alt-F# will work. Changing video mode at startup also does not work.</p>  <p>There were lots of packages that were upgraded, but the ones that could mess up the boot as far as I could tell would only be the kernel and acipid. I reinstalled those, to no avail.</p>

non-duplicate	Deciding between virtual machine or dual-boot setup<p>I would like to set-up a PC to run ubuntu most of the time, but also need to run XP for specific applications and testing. In the past I would have simply set up a dual boot machine and then restart and boot into windows XP as needed.  </p>  <p>However since the machine has multiple cores and significant memory, I think I can use Virtual Box, Xen, or VMWare hypervisors. I am thinking of making Ubuntu the "host" VM and having XP as a guest VM. This would be especially nice for testing/debug/development since it is possible to run applications in both OS's simultaneously. I've never setup a virtual machine before and think that by asking the questions below I can avoid some trial-and-error.</p>  <p>Basically, I need to decide if a dual boot or VM setup is more appropriate for what I want to do.</p>  <p>Here's my questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I do not always need to have XP running. Do the hypervisors allow me to shut the guest VM down so that the host VM can then immediately use all memory and processor resources? When I then bring up the guest VM, is it easy to provision how much memory and other resources are used by it? Ideally, I'd like to pre-configure this in advance and then toggle the guest VM off/on without thinking about it.</p></li> <li><p>Is it possible or advisable to have the host OS be 64bit and the guest OS be 32bit? Alternatively, if both VM's are 32 bit and I have 8G of RAM, can the hypervisor provision each VM with 4G of RAM when they are running simultaneously?</p></li> <li><p>Which hypervisors are best for set-ups such as I described?</p></li> </ol> 	Display brightness goes all the way up or all the way down when I make slight adjustement<p>I just fresh installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a MSI MS-16362 laptop. When ever I try to increase the display brightness with Fn + F5 or decrease it with Fn + F4, the brightness amount either goes through every brightness value until it is at it's brightest or dimmest.

It finds and loads the file as it should in Firefox.</p>  <p>Also, it doesn't seem to be the same four files every time.  I've seen the Steam, Dropbox, Chrome, and Virtualbox repos all error out at various times.  It's always only four repos, and it's different every time.  None of them have any problem loading in Firefox, and the fact that they resolve sometimes but not others makes me wonder how it could be DNS related.</p>  <p>But at the same time, this started happening around the time we upgraded to AT&amp;T U-Verse.  I'm just confused.  I don't want to go messing with DNS settings, but at the same time I need apt to update everything.</p>  <p>(UPDATE) I decided to disable all third-party repos to see if that helps.  With all of them disabled, there were no errors.  I enabled VirtualBox, no error.  I added Wine, no error.  I added Steam, one error.  I added Chrome, three errors.  I disabled Chrome, and it's back to one error.  It seems like the more third-party sources I add, the more errors I get.  And it's not the newly enabled sources that are erroring out.  When I enabled Steam, it was the VirtualBox repo that threw the error.  When I enabled Chrome, it was two Ubuntu.com and the Steam repos that threw errors.  Then when I disabled Chrome, it was the VirtualBox repo that errored again.  I tried once more and Steam threw the error.</p>  <p>I don't know if there was an update to apt around the time this all started happening, but I seem to be having a problem where I can only have two third-party sources on at one time without causing errors.</p>

This causes problems because I can't alter files that I upload with one device with the other device. </p>  <p>I want to be able to upload things while I'm out and about, and be able to rsync my laptop when I'm working, and then be able to open the files from my phone later, and this is preventing that. </p> 	core i7 installation problems<p>First of all I tried booting from both USB, CD and DVD, as well as installing from Windows, as well as trying both 32 and 64 bit versions, however nothing works for some reason.</p>  <p>Trying ubuntu works, but it takes approximately 20 minutes to load and when it does it works fine.</p>  <p>In ubuntu when I try to install onto a hard drive it takes again 20 minutes to prepare for installation.

non-duplicate	Ubuntu 11.10 running in windows 7 (wubi) AND on a separate partition<p>I am in a very strange situation and need some help: I installed Ubuntu 11.10 through Wubi a while back so that I can use it alongside Windows 7.  I was running out of space on my disk when trying to install applications.  Without understanding how Wubi worked, I partitioned my C drive (creating a new 90 GB partition) in Windows, booted from the Ubuntu 11.10 install/live disk, and used the "something else" option to create a ext4 (setting the mount point to root) and swap space partitions (/sda5 and /sda6).  After the install, my computer no longer boots with the previous Wubi menu and is now using the Linux grub.  The options I have are /sda2, which boots Windows 7; /sda1, which doesn't do anything and reloads the same menu, and the run Linux options.  So I now have Ubuntu running on a separate partition, as well as the original Wubi install.  I want to delete the seperate partition and go back to running Ubuntu on Wubi...if I remove the partition will I  need the Windows 7 disk to restore the boot loader?  I dont have the Windows 7 disk on me so what is the best way to clean this up so I get rid of the seperate partition?     </p>  <p>-------------------------------------------------UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------</p>  <p>============================================================================================================</p>  <p>thank you so much for your response.  Actually, it would be fantastic if I could migrate my Wubi install into the new partition because I had downloaded the AOSP on the Wubi install (as well as other files) and would love to preserve them.  If i can do that and work on the new partition with the old files than that would be great, and I can worry about wiping out the partition completely later on i.e. when I have the windows disk or something.  Can you tell me how to do this migration??  So when I select the /sda2, it loads up my Windows.  If i click on the Linux, it loads up the newly install Linux (my files that were on the Wubi install aren't there) fine.  If I click on the /sda1 (SYSTEM_DRIVE... this is what the Wubi was using to boot the menu that let me select Windows 7 or Ubuntu)... it fails and just reloads the original menu.  </p>  <p>Here is the link to my boot info script <a href="http://pastebin.com/dMrY0NL3" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/dMrY0NL3</a></p>  <p>------------------------------------------------------EDIT 2-------------------------------------------------</p>  <p>I really appreciate the help bcbc.  So I used the repair disk to run the "bootrec /fixboot", which now brings me to the Wubi Windows boot menu... It asks to select Windows 7 or Ubuntu just like it originally did.

However, if I choose Ubuntu, it starts to boot Ubuntu by displaying the Ubuntu logo with the progress bar, then displays the purple screen.  After this, it goes to dark screen and just sits there until I have to power off.

Do I merely install the kde-base pacakge, or must I modify the source code of the build file to access the kde-base package?</p>  <p>I am considering installing another version of compiz, but have not been able to determine the most stable version. If I can first install compiz, I will move on to modifying existing plug ins and develop my own. My end goal is to update a plug in developed for an earlier release of compiz to the latest release. Any answers to my compilation query, or links to resources on learning how to develop compiz tutorials would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

duplicate	How can I remove duplicate icons for "launched" java programs in the launcher?<p>When launching java programs (like IntelliJ IDEA and Crashplan) in Natty's Unity launcher, duplicate icons are shown (see image).  For IntelliJ I created the .desktop file, for Crashplan the .desktop file is supplied with the application.  Is there something that can be changed in the .desktop files (or somewhere else) that can prevent this from occurring?

I'm a new Linux user, but what confuses me is that I was able to install Ubuntu alongside Windows on my laptop with no problems, but on PC... no way!</p> 	Installing Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8.1<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 5520 (8GB Ram, 1TB HDD) and I have installed Windows 8.1 x64 on it. I want to install Ubuntu and dual boot Windows 8.1 with Ubuntu but I can't (my problem isn't the dual booting process, which I can fix later using EasyBCD), Ubuntu won't install.</p>  <p>When I boot from the live CD I have no option to "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8" and when I choose "Something else..." it shows me my partitions which are all used by Windows (System reserved, reserved, etc..) and the one partition that I wanted to install Ubuntu on is "unusable". My disk is MBR and I think the problem is having more than 4 partitions. I created another Local Disk from inside Windows but Ubuntu just sees that drive and the drive I shrinked to make it as one partition. </p>  <p>So, right now I want to install Ubuntu without killing my Windows (if it's possible). Perhaps there is some way I can make an extended partition and use that but I don't know how to (I can shrink one of my drives but that wouldn't make a new partition would it?).</p>  <p>Here is a screenshot of GParted in Ubuntu:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SNpgQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <ul> <li>I don't know why the 800 GB is unallocated, in Windows, it is consisted of 2 drives (I've named them Local Disk E:\ and L:)</li> </ul>  <p>Also, when I right-click on that 800 GB partition and click on "New..." it gives me this error:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PsZfP.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Which makes sense and is exactly what I'm trying to do but I don't know which partition I can remove so that my Windows doesn't break.
