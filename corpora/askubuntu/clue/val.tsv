non-duplicate	how can i install ubuntu 32 bit arquitechture when i am currently running a 64 bit windiws 7 when i downloaded ubuntu from the ubuntu page it asked me my architechture of preference i obviously chose x64-bit i have been trying to install skype but it is impossible on the 64 bit version of ubuntu so i tried to download the 32 bit version of ubuntu instead every time i choose 32 bits when installing it automatically installs the 64 bit version this is because i am currently running a 64 bit version of windows and i do know what to do for it not to acknowledge that it 's a 64 bit system can someone please tell me how to either install ubuntu 32 bits or skype on a 64 bit ubuntu thanks	ubuntu lts fails to boot after linux kernel update and restart on intel core i7-3720qm cpu ghz 8 laptop i did the most recent updates as i regularly do but this time i got the black screen of death after restarting no way i can get the system to boot even though the boot options and bios settings look right to me i ran ubuntu from a cd and i can see the hd partitions but ca access the files because i am not the owner owner 1000 user 1000 what is the best way to recover my data what boot recovery tools are to use i wonder if this happens to other distros that have a reputation for more testing like fedora or opensuse any comments would be welcome on this subject thanks pablo
non-duplicate	how do i get close to 1600x1600 resolution with dual monitors i have a pair of 1440 x 900 monitors that i want to run in portrait mode not mirrored when i select 800 x 600 for both it works but i am not near the maximum of the monitor hardware nor am i near what appears to be the addressable space of 1600 x 1600 if i select 1280 x 800 for both i get the following error the selected configuration could not be applied requested for crtc 148 is outside the allowed limit position size maximum superficially it appears this error is a bug a pair of 800 pixels side by side when in portrait does not exceed 1600 and of course 1280 does not exceed it how can i get this to work of course i would prefer a pair set to 1440 x 900 which is the actual lcd resolution but then of course the 900 side by side pair would total 1800 and so i wo even bother with that the correct rotation setting seems to be counterclockwise i am using ubuntu and a radeon hd 5450 and the catalyst for x86-64 architecture i am dual booting i had no complaints with the visual quality on windows 7 it looked good and used the natural resolution 1440 x 900 even in portrait thus it seems safe to conclude the hardware can do it but ubuntu and the driver for ubuntu is at fault although it would be a shame to do so given the windows 7 example i would be willing to buy a new video card if a card and driver combination successfully displays dual monitors in 1440 x 900 each non-mirrored portrait on ubuntu please post a comment if you have this working at this point i would even consider landscape non-mirrored dual monitors	does ubuntu lts work with only 736mb of ram i want to install it on my old desktop pc here is it 's specs cpu intel pentium ram 736 mb vram 256mb hdd 120gb i can install the following oses on it windows vista home basic mac os x leopard ubuntu lts

duplicate	connection cuts borders of screen or creates blurry text ok this is an extension of another problem i had with a vga connection and an nvidia geforce gt 440 card the question has been updated to include other problems related to hdmi video and also since i have confirmed that it also affects ati video cards the explanation is the following i have a soneview 32 tv this tv has many connections including vga first reason i bought it hdmi second reason but did not have a hdmi cable at that time and dvi i have had this tv for little over a month now actually i had it to celebrate the release of ubuntu and started using it exactly on that date i know too much fan there but hey i like geek stuff i started using it with the vga cable after 2 weeks i bought an nvidia gt440 card the previous 9500gt which was using the vga connection was working correctly with no problems whatsoever i installed the gt440 and the first problem that i encountered using this latest card is mentioned here black screen on latest cards when starting the solution to this problem was to actually disconnect then connect again the vga cable this would result in the screen showing me the lightdm screen for my login if i did not disconnect then connect the cable i could be there forever thinking that there is no video signal the black screen problem was solved in a later update for and already solved using the default so using and updating or using solved the black screen with hdmi problem i got tired of looking for answers that did not work and for solutions that made me literally have to install ubuntu again i just went and bought an hdmi cable and changed the vga one for that one it worked and i did not have to the cable but now i have this problem when using any resolution my normal resolution is 1920x1080 this tv is 1080hd so in vga i could use this resolution with no problem but on hdmi am getting the borders cut out here is a pic as you can see from the image the launcher icons only show less than 50 of their width forget about the top and bottom parts i can access them with the mouse but i can not visualize them in the screen it is like it 's outside of the tvs view basically there is like 20 to 30 pixels gone from all sides i searched around and came to running xrand verbose to see what it could detect from the tv i got this xrandr verbose xrandr failed

settings the problem is about half a centimeter is cut off of the top and bottom of the screen a good centimeter is cut off both right and left sides in addition to it being to zoomed in the quality of the image is not very good image does look sharp or crisp at all colors are dull and nothing is overly vibrant poor picture quality in general here 's the catch this exact monitor and the graphics card worked great on ubuntu but ever since i upgraded to the display has been crappy in display under system settings it shows the display as unknown and the resolution is set to the maximum 1280 x 720 also i went into my monitor 's settings and ensured that the vertical and horizontal were not increased or dis-positioned to create this zoomed in effect any help is much appreciated thanks
